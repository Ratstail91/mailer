Hi there!

This week, just for you, I've created a special discount offer for Can't Anyone Save The World? and it's expansion modules!

Cast World: http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?discount=9f5477b07e
The Beggar King: http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?discount=9f22ddf856
The Crystal Tree: http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?discount=9f2136a026

I'm also working hard on The Mouth Of Tiamat, Cast World's companion dungeon generator! It's looking good, but my editor is a stickler for details, so it's only gonna get better!

Best regards,

Kayne Ruse
