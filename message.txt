So it's been a while since I wrote one of these, but I'm proud to say that I haven't been wasting (too much) time!

I've written a tabletop RPG called Cast World (short for "Can't Anyone Save The World?"). It's currently available for $2.49 USD:

Be sure to check the errata page, because I plan on doing one massive update in March, to incorporate everything that I've added in the meantime:

Finally, if you're not sure if you would like my game sight unseen, I've made a short rules preview available for free:

I'm planning on adding a new adventure module once every two weeks, so please check the store page often!

Thanks for reading, and I hope that you stick with me and my projects for a long time to come.

Best regards,
